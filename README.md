Autofill Binghamton University 2fa

## Tired of checking your authenticator app every 30 minutes to login to your BU account?
Fret no more. With bing2fa, you will never need to input your OTP again. After installing via the [chrome web store page](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bing2fa/bggmcalehpfhejdoleaeijedpchhlcdj), you can go to https://password.binghamton.edu, create a new 2FA token, and bing2fa will do the rest, provided you accept the prompt.

*Note: This does not remove the protection of 2fa from your account, as it simply locally stores your 2fa key within your chrome browser storage. This will not sync between different devices or chrome profiles.*
