    <strong>Warning:</strong>
    Your 2FA secret is stored in plain text and is vulnerable if
    your Chrome profile is compromised. Protect your computer and
    Chrome profile with strong passwords. (Note: the secret will not sync between
    different devices, for security purposes; you will need to manually add it to all
    devices you plan to use the extension on.)
